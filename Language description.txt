Grammar:

PROG := LINE PROG | LINE EOF
LINE := LINESTART EXPR \n | COMMENT \n
LINESTART := simon says
|COMMENT := [any old string]
EXPR := ASSN | OP | CMD | DEFUN
OP := ADD | SUB | DIV | MULT
ADD := add CONSTANT to VARNAME
SUB := take CONSTANT from VARNAME
DIV := divide VARNAME by CONSTANT
MULT := multiply VARNAME by CONSTANT
CMD := repeat after me: CONSTANT | give back CONSTANT | FUNCALL | IF | LOOP
ASSN := put CONSTANT in VARNAME
CONSTANT := VARNAME | VALUE
VARNAME := the [just a non-keyword string]
VALUE := INT | STRING | FUNCALL | BOOL
INT := [0-9]*
STRING := “ [any old string] ”
BOOL := true | false
BOOLEXPR := BOOL | CONSTANT is smaller than CONSTANT | CONSTANT is bigger than CONSTANT | CONSTANT is like CONSTANT | CONSTANT is not like CONSTANT
DEFUN := learn to dance VARNAME using ARGSLIST \n LINE* ENDDEF
ENDDEF := LINESTART you’ve learned VARNAME
ARGSLIST := VARNAME, ARGSLIST | VARNAME
FUNCALL := do VARNAME with FUNCALLARGS
FUNCALLARGS := CONSTANT, ARGSLIST | CONSTANT
IF := maybe BOOLEXPR LINE* ELSES ENDIF | maybe BOOLEXPR LINE* ENDIF
ELSES := but maybe BOOLEXPR ELSES | but maybe BOOLEXPR
ENDIF := LINESTART but then again
LOOP := as long as BOOLEXPR LINE* ENDLOOP
ENDLOOP := LINESTART stop looping!
